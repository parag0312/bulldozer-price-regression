# Bulldozer-Price-Regression <br>

Predicting Sales prices !?<br>
predicting Stocks!?<br>
Predicting Real estate market!?<br>

Looks all imaginery?<br>
How cool is this. Just Imagine!! But how?<br> 

Can we build a machine learning model which predicts future? Looks all imaginery and magical? But is it possible?<br>
Indeed it is and it's no magic,it's simple maths. May be not so simple sometimes :D. Using maths, models/estimators are created which predicts future sales.

**In this notebook, we're going to go through an example of machine learning project with the goal of predicting the sale price of bulldozers.**
